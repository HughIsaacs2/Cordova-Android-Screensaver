Android Screensaver Plugin for Cordova
==============================

I'm far from done, so this isn't to be used by anyone yet. I'm just sharing the code in case you wish to tear it apart and build you own or whatever.

Right now it's super barebones and just loads "screensaver.html" from the WWW folder in a regular non-Cordova WebView (I'll add Cordova WebView support soon).
